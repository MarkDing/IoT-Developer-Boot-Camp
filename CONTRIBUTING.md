# 1. Code of Conduct
All of the contributor involved in this project is governed by the [IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). This is a open source project, and every participating in it can provide your comments on it, submit your pull request for bug fix, new feature implementation or documentation improvement.

# 2. Contributing Guideline
## 2.1. Coding Standard
All of the source code of this project are hosted by the repository [IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp/), for contributing your source code, please refer to the [coding standard](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp/blob/master/CODING-STANDARD.md) for the description about the coding standard used in the IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp project.  

## 2.2. Documentation Rule
Every GitHub repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. In this project, all of the documentation of the repository are hosted in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp/wiki).  
Wikis are available to the public in public repository, which is [IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp-Wiki](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp-Wiki) in this project, user can access and contribute the documentations by following the [code of conduct](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). For contributing to this repository, it highly recommended to write content in Markdown.  

There are several different directories for different wireless sub projects in the Wiki repository [IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp-Wiki](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp-Wiki), such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Proprietary respectively. All of the markdown files of the sub projects should be placed in the associated directory. In addition, there is a dedicated subdirectory ***files*** in each directory used for organizing all of the attachments of the sub projects, that includes images, scripts, slides and any other documentations except markdown.  

The directory structure of the Wiki repository seems like below. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/Miscellaneous/contributing-directory-structure.png">
</div>

   **zigbee**: documentations for the Zigbee boot camp.  
   **bluetooth**: documentations for the Bluetooth boot camp.  
   **proprietary**: documentations for the Proprietary boot camp.  
   **zwave**: documentations for the ZWave boot camp.  
   **hardware**: documentations for the Hardware boot camp.  
   **common**: documentations for the fundamental IoT introduction, wireless fundamentals.  
   **files**: Contains all of the copy of the subdirectories in the **files** folder of each sub projects.  

Please note that all of the folder name and file name includes documentations and images should be connected with dash line '-' if multiple words present. And a subdirectory under the ***files*** folder is required to organize the materials for each topic, the subdirectory name should same as the associated markdown file of that topic except following a prefix for better readability.  
Take the Zigbee hands on topic "Hands on : Forming and Joining" as example, there are many screenshots and script are included in this documentations, we created a subdirectory "ZB-Hands-on-Forming-and-Joining" under the ***files*** folder to organize the screenshots and script, the prefix "ZB" refers to "Zigbee". The table below defines different prefix for different wireless sub projects.  

Wireless Protocol | Prefix
-|-
zigbee | ZB
bluetooth | BL
proprietary | PR
zwave | ZW
hardware | HW
common | CM

We didn't define the naming rule about the images, however, the basic principle is that use the clear abbreviations to avoid too long file name, and make sure the name convey the purpose of the picture (or screenshot) as clearly as possible.  

## 2.3. How to Get Code ?
The user can access and read the source code online [here](https://github.com/MarkDing/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp), or clone all source code from github to local with command line or GUI tool (for e.g., [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)).  
Please note that in order to maintain the repository effectively, we only grant user permissions of reading, and user cannot commit the changes to these repositories directly.  
For contributing, the recommended approach is that forking the repository firstly, and then clone your own forked repository. You can commit any changes to the fork by following the [Coding Standard](#21-coding-standard) and [Documentation Rule](#22-documentation-rule). And then open a Pull Request to the upstream repository in your fork.  
If use the command line, clone the repo with this command:  
`git clone https://github.com/<your github name>/IoT-Developer-Boot-Camp.git -b <branch_name>`

please refer to the section [Pull Request](#25-pull-requests) for how to contribute your source code and documentations to the repository.  

## 2.4. Reporting Issues
This section guides you how to report a issue to us. We created three templates for different report type, **Bug Report**, **Feature Request** and **Documentation Improvement** request.
